# Bootstrap-Bordered-Table-Example
This program demonstrates the implementation of a bordered table using Bootstrap. The table is styled with the .table and .table-bordered classes, providing a distinct border around each cell. It includes columns for "Prenom" (First Name), "Nom" (Last Name), and "Age," and rows with sample data.
